## Background

I initially made a web based Marz Designer, it is still active at: https://marzguitars.com/marz-designer/
and it is very practical for quick calculations and references, but it is 2D and lacks some features like ZeroFret support.

I decided to go to the next level and make it 3D, so I started this project and work on this in my
free time. This is a work in progress thing.
